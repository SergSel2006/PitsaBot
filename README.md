# PitsaBot

I am introducing my bot! I'm working on it as a hobby, so, i'm not actively very improving it, sometimes i even just
don't know what to add.

# What it should be?

At least in my dreams this is a multi-functual bot with many original features and it is intended to replace that 2 or 3
bots on a server that I usually see everywhere. Also, It should have very polite and good community (which is usually
never true).

# And what Now?

Now, we have very small features, like ban and purge commands. And that's all... Also I am working on warn command, but
first should do kick fast before continue my work on warn... I even don't have normal host for bot, so, I don't think
that it will find small community now...

# Where community lives?

There was discord server, but I deleted it. There will be announcment if I r5ecreate it. I totally don't have time and ideas to work...

# I'm Interested! How can I help you?

That's good! If you know Python and discord.py, you can help with my work (you know... fork, make changes, open pull
request and wait). Also if you can advise good and free bot hosting, I will listen to you. Since I hadn't set up help
button yet, you cannot help with money, just if you wanted to give me some.

P.S: to test your changes, you can create your own bot. To do this get your own token, make config.yml file in root
folder of bot, and make `token: [your token]` in it and bot will start

# Your Project is disaster! How you can do it in this way!

Yes, I know that my project is trash now, and idea is somehow fantastic, but hey, why don't YOU just make some help over
here, I will accept even small code refactoring if it refactored by PEP 8.
